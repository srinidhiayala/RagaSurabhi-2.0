Hey there! This project is inspired by https://www.ragasurabhi.com and expands upon it to help students learn more about Indian Carnatic Music ragams (scales). This application is developed in Flask using Python in the backend to scrape the existing website and HTML and CSS on the front end for UI/UX. This 2.0 version aims to: 
1) Use an AI chatbot to help users engage with the material better
2) Provide a webpage to compare different ragams to see how they are similar and/or different
3) Showcase the informaion about each raga in a more concise and minimalistic way
4) Educate on the mathematics behind Carnatic music and the "parent", "child" raga structure
5) Utilize audio files to help users correlate ragas with its sound
